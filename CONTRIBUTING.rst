Contributing
=============


The **GEO Knowledge Hub** is a digital repository of Earth Observations applications, based on `InvenioRDM <https://inveniosoftware.org/products/rdm/>`_, a framework designed to develop turn-key data management repository platform in an open-source and collaborative way.


How does the GEO Knowledge Hub work ?
-------------------------------------


InvenioRDM provides the essential and basic structure for the GEO Knowledge Hub, but customization regarding some elements is done in order to accommodate the needs of the GEO community. The customization mainly pertains to the following elements:

- General theme: how the resources are searched, presented and uploaded within the platform.

- Content: metadata fields added to the existing metadata schema.

- Communities: organization for the GEO Work Programme activities.


How can I contribute ?
----------------------


The GEO Knowledge Hub is fully open-source and we want its development to be as transparent as possible. We welcome contributions, whether they are done to report bugs, fix bugs or to submit ideas for new features.


Report bugs
+++++++++++


We use Github Issues to keep a public track of bugs. If you find a bug or an unexpected behaviour when using the GEO Knowledge Hub, please check if there is already a mention of it in the `issues page <https://github.com/geo-knowledge-hub/geo-knowledge-hub/issues>`_.


If you don't see any reference to it, please submit a new issue with a self-explanatory title, with the tag "bug" and with the following indications:

- Context of the bug (e.g. when trying to upload a file, searching for records, managing a community page).

- Operations you performed.

- What you expected to happen.

- What actually happened.

- Don't hesitate to add screenshots or anything that might help us locate and resolve the problem.


Fix bugs
++++++++


If you noticed a bug in the system, please feel free to propose a solution! First you will need to install, see the GEO Knowledge Hub `installation steps <https://github.com/geo-knowledge-hub/geo-knowledge-hub-rt/blob/master/INSTALL.rst>`_. For a more general deployment guide, please also refer to the `InvenioRDM docs page <https://inveniordm.docs.cern.ch/>`_.


We use the `Github Flow <https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html>`_ so all changes in the code are done through Pull Requests. Further information on how to make use `Github guide for the GEO Knowledge hub <https://github.com/geo-knowledge-hub/geo-knowledge-hub-rt/blob/master/GITHUB.rst>`_ is available.


Once your environment is set and you have made the necessary changes, send a Pull Request clearly indicating the addressed related issue in the commit message. Please also provide a short summary about the key changes you made in order to fix the bug.


Submit ideas for new features
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


The continuous gathering of feedback on the web interface of the GKH is of paramount importance, as this is a platform designed to serve the community. If you are a user, a knowledge provider or involved in a community and you would like to see new functionalities to be developed, please open a new issue with the tag "enhancement" as well as the following elements:

- Add a brief description of the additional feature you would like to see.

- Explain why you think it could be useful to the community, what problem this would solve.

- Describe the components and/or the workflow you think could be implemented.

- If this functionality is already existing in another platform, please provide a link or some documentation to consider.


Implement Features
++++++++++++++++++


Look through the `GitHub issues <https://github.com/geo-knowledge-hub/geo-knowledge-hub-rt/issues>`_ for features. Anything tagged with "feature" is open to whoever wants to implement it.


Write Documentation
+++++++++++++++++++


Contributions to the GEO Knowledge Hub documentation are most welcome!
